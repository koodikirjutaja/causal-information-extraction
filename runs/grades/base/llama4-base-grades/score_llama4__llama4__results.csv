row1,0.0,0.0,0.0,the introduction of algorithmic trading strategies emerged,increased volatility in financial markets occurring,Introduction of algorithmic trading strategies,Increased volatility in financial markets,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Introduction of algorithmic trading strategies""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the introduction of algorithmic trading strategies emerged""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""introduction of algorithmic trading strategies,"" which matches the ground truth. The addition of ""emerged"" does not change the core meaning; it slightly rephrases the introduction aspect. Thus, the cause is semantically similar to the ground truth cause.

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased volatility in financial markets""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased volatility in financial markets occurring""
   
   The predicted effect contains the same core concept as the ground truth effect, which is ""increased volatility in financial markets."" The addition of ""occurring"" is a minor rephrasing that doesn't alter the fundamental meaning. Hence, the predicted effect is semantically identical to the ground truth effect.

Given the analysis, both the cause and effect components of the predicted pair are semantically identical to their respective ground truth components. The minor variations in wording (""emerged"" and ""occurring"") do not change the"

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Increased international trade tariffs""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""increased international trade tariffs and the broader economic environment""
   
   The predicted cause includes the exact phrase ""increased international trade tariffs"" found in the ground truth cause, which is a key element. However, it also adds ""and the broader economic environment,"" which introduces additional information not present in the ground truth cause. The core concept of ""increased international trade tariffs"" is preserved, but the addition of ""the broader economic environment"" slightly alters the focus by broadening the cause beyond just tariffs. Thus, the predicted cause is not an exact match but retains the core concept with additional detail. This suggests a partial match.

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Reduction in import-dependent industries' profitability""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""reduction in import-dependent industries' profitability""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect, both in wording and meaning. This indicates an exact match.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Enhanced data privacy legislation""
   - Predicted Cause: ""broader legal shifts""
   
   The ground truth cause specifically mentions ""Enhanced data privacy legislation,"" which implies a change or strengthening in laws related to data privacy. The predicted cause, ""broader legal shifts,"" is more general and could encompass changes in various legal areas, not just data privacy. While ""Enhanced data privacy legislation"" can be considered a type of ""broader legal shifts,"" the predicted cause lacks the specificity of the ground truth cause. Therefore, it's a partial match because it captures the general idea of a legal change but misses the specific focus on data privacy.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased compliance costs for businesses""
   - Predicted Effect: ""the increase in compliance costs for businesses""
   
   The predicted effect is essentially semantically identical to the ground truth effect. Both phrases convey the idea that businesses are facing higher costs to comply with certain requirements. The difference is minor and does not change the core meaning.

Given the analysis:
- The cause is a partial match because while ""broader"
row7,0.0,0.0,0.0,adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs),"changes in cash usage, which notably declined during the same period",Adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs),Decline in traditional cash usage,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: Adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
   - Predicted Cause: adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
   
   The predicted cause is identical to the ground truth cause. Both refer to the adoption of CBDCs as the cause. Therefore, the cause_score should be 1.0 because it is an exact match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: Decline in traditional cash usage
   - Predicted Effect: changes in cash usage, which notably declined during the same period
   
   The predicted effect mentions ""changes in cash usage, which notably declined during the same period."" This indicates a decline in cash usage, similar to the ground truth effect. Although the predicted effect provides more context by mentioning ""changes"" and ""during the same period,"" the core concept of a decline in cash usage is maintained. The addition of ""notably declined during the same period"" suggests a causal or temporal relationship but doesn't alter the core effect of declining cash usage. Thus, the predicted effect is semantically similar to the ground truth effect, capturing the essence of"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expansion of financial literacy education""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the growing focus on financial knowledge""

Both causes relate to the idea of increasing or enhancing financial understanding or education among individuals. ""Financial literacy education"" and ""financial knowledge"" are closely related concepts, as financial literacy is essentially about having knowledge regarding financial matters. The phrases ""Expansion of"" and ""the growing focus on"" both convey an increase or heightened emphasis on the subject. Therefore, while not identical, they convey a very similar idea.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased household savings rates""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased household savings rates""

The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect. Both state ""increased household savings rates,"" indicating a perfect match.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause: The core concept is similar, as both relate to an increase in financial understanding or education. Thus, it can be considered a partial match with a score of **0.5** or even a higher score if one considers the semantic similarity to be very strong. Upon closer inspection,"

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Growth of fintech lending platforms""
   - Predicted Cause: ""fintech grew""

The ground truth cause mentions the ""growth of fintech lending platforms,"" which implies an expansion or increase in fintech lending activities. The predicted cause states ""fintech grew,"" which is a more general statement but still conveys the idea of growth or expansion in the fintech sector. Although ""fintech grew"" is less specific than ""growth of fintech lending platforms,"" it captures the core concept of growth in fintech. Therefore, it can be considered a partial match because it doesn't specify ""lending platforms,"" but it still relates to the overall growth in fintech, which could reasonably include lending platforms.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Improved access to credit for small businesses""
   - Predicted Effect: ""improved access to credit for small businesses was observed""

The predicted effect is ""improved access to credit for small businesses was observed,"" which is semantically very similar to the ground truth effect, ""Improved access to credit for small businesses."" The addition of ""was observed"" in the predicted effect doesn't change"
row12,0.0,0.0,0.0,the sudden bankruptcy of major banks,investor confidence appeared to decline,Sudden bankruptcy of major banks,Decline in investor confidence,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Sudden bankruptcy of major banks""
   - Predicted: ""the sudden bankruptcy of major banks""

   The predicted cause includes the definite article ""the"" and is otherwise identical to the ground truth cause. The core concept and details are the same; the addition of ""the"" does not change the meaning. Thus, the cause is semantically identical.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Decline in investor confidence""
   - Predicted: ""investor confidence appeared to decline""

   The predicted effect conveys a similar meaning to the ground truth effect. The phrase ""appeared to decline"" suggests a perceived or observed decline, which aligns with the actual ""decline"" mentioned in the ground truth. The core concept of a decrease in investor confidence is maintained. However, ""appeared to decline"" introduces a nuance regarding the certainty or observation of the decline, whereas ""decline"" is a more direct statement.

Given these observations:

- For the **cause**, the predicted and ground truth are semantically identical, so the score should be 1.0.
- For the"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Surge in remote banking services""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the ongoing rise in remote banking services""
   
   Both causes refer to an increase in remote banking services. The terms ""surge"" and ""ongoing rise"" convey a similar meaning of an upward trend. Thus, the predicted cause is semantically identical to the ground truth cause.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decline in physical bank branch numbers""
   - Predicted Effect: ""physical bank branches saw a marked decline""
   
   Both effects talk about a decrease in the number of physical bank branches. The phrase ""decline in physical bank branch numbers"" and ""physical bank branches saw a marked decline"" essentially convey the same meaning, with ""marked decline"" emphasizing the extent of the decline. The core concept is the same.

Given the analysis:
- The cause is semantically identical (Score: 1.0).
- The effect is also semantically identical (Score: 1.0).

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of AI-driven credit scoring""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the technology""
   
   The predicted cause, ""the technology,"" is somewhat vague but could be interpreted as referring to ""AI-driven credit scoring"" if we consider the context. However, it lacks specificity. ""AI-driven credit scoring"" is a specific technology, and saying ""the technology"" could refer to any technology. Thus, while it might be related, it's not a precise match. Therefore, it should be considered a partial match because it doesn't directly state ""AI-driven credit scoring"" but could be interpreted to refer to it in context.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased accuracy in loan approvals""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased accuracy in loan approvals""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect. Both state ""increased accuracy in loan approvals,"" which means they are semantically identical.

Given the analysis:
- The cause score should be 0.5 because ""the technology"" is a partial match to ""Adoption of AI-driven credit scoring."" It"

The ground truth pair is:
- Cause: Reduction of foreign direct investment due to economic sanctions
- Effect: Slowed economic growth

The predicted pair is:
- Cause: Slowed economic growth
- Effect: Reduction of foreign direct investment

First, let's examine the cause and effect individually.

1. **Cause Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: Reduction of foreign direct investment due to economic sanctions
   - Predicted Cause: Slowed economic growth
   The predicted cause (""slowed economic growth"") is actually the effect in the ground truth. The core concept in the ground truth cause involves ""reduction of foreign direct investment,"" which is not present in the predicted cause. Hence, the cause is not a match. Score: 0

2. **Effect Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: Slowed economic growth
   - Predicted Effect: Reduction of foreign direct investment
   Similar to the cause, the predicted effect (""reduction of foreign direct investment"") is the cause in the ground truth. The core concept here (""reduction of foreign direct investment"") is not the same as ""slowed economic growth."" Thus, the effect is also not a match. Score:"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Strengthened anti-money laundering policies""
   - Predicted Cause: ""these legal adjustments""
   
   The ground truth cause specifically mentions ""anti-money laundering policies,"" which implies a particular type of legal adjustment. The predicted cause, ""these legal adjustments,"" is more general and refers back to some legal adjustments mentioned elsewhere. If the context is that ""these legal adjustments"" refer to strengthened anti-money laundering policies, then it could be considered a partial match because it doesn't specify the type of legal adjustments. However, it captures the essence that some form of legal or regulatory change is being referred to. Thus, it can be considered a partial match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased administrative overhead for banks""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased administrative overhead""
   
   The predicted effect captures the core concept of ""increased administrative overhead,"" which is present in the ground truth effect. The ground truth effect specifies that this overhead is ""for banks,"" adding a detail about who is affected. The predicted effect omits this detail but still conveys the main idea of"
row24,0.0,0.0,0.0,the shift toward digital payment systems accelerated,Physical currency circulation naturally declined,Shift towards digital payment systems,Reduced circulation of physical currency,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Shift towards digital payment systems""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the shift toward digital payment systems accelerated""
   
   The predicted cause and the ground truth cause both refer to a movement or transition towards using digital payment systems more. The key difference is that the predicted cause includes the word ""accelerated,"" suggesting a faster or more rapid shift. Despite this difference, the core concept of shifting towards digital payment systems is maintained in both. Therefore, the predicted cause is considered a partial match because it conveys a similar overall idea but with an additional detail (acceleration) not present in the ground truth.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduced circulation of physical currency""
   - Predicted Effect: ""Physical currency circulation naturally declined""
   
   Both the ground truth effect and the predicted effect convey the idea that the circulation or use of physical currency has decreased. The predicted effect uses the word ""naturally"" and ""declined"" instead of ""reduced,"" but the overall meaning remains the same - a decrease in physical currency circulation. Thus, the predicted effect is semantically identical to the ground"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of electric vehicles""
   - Predicted Cause: ""large-scale adoption of electric vehicles""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""adoption of electric vehicles"" but adds the detail ""large-scale."" While ""large-scale"" provides additional specificity, the fundamental concept of adopting electric vehicles is preserved. The addition of ""large-scale"" could be seen as an intensification or a condition of the adoption rather than a completely different cause. Thus, the core concept is similar, but there's an additional detail in the prediction. This suggests a partial match because the essence of the cause (adoption of electric vehicles) is captured, but the scale is specified in the prediction.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduction in urban air pollution""
   - Predicted Effect: ""a reduction in urban air pollution on transit corridors""
   
   The predicted effect contains the core concept of ""reduction in urban air pollution,"" which matches the ground truth effect. However, it adds the specificity ""on transit corridors."" This addition narrows down the scope of where the reduction in urban air"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Extensive fertilizer runoff""
   - Predicted Cause: ""basins with extensive fertilizer runoff""

The predicted cause includes the phrase ""basins with"" in addition to ""extensive fertilizer runoff."" The core concept of ""extensive fertilizer runoff"" is present in both, but the predicted cause adds a specific context (""basins with"") that is not in the ground truth. However, the essential cause (""extensive fertilizer runoff"") is still captured. The addition of ""basins with"" provides more context but doesn't change the core cause. Thus, it's a partial match because it includes the core concept but adds specificity not present in the ground truth.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems""
   - Predicted Effect: ""Increased eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems""

The predicted effect is exactly the same as the ground truth effect. Therefore, it is an exact match.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause: Since the core concept is similar but the predicted cause includes additional context (""basins with""), it is considered a partial match. Thus"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Rapid glacial retreat in mountainous regions""
   - Predicted Cause: ""periods marked by rapid glacial retreat in mountainous regions""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""rapid glacial retreat in mountainous regions"" but adds ""periods marked by."" The addition of ""periods marked by"" suggests a timeframe or specific instances when this occurs, rather than the event itself. Despite this addition, the fundamental cause (rapid glacial retreat in mountainous regions) is still present and understood. The meaning remains largely intact, and the core concept is preserved.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduced freshwater availability""
   - Predicted Effect: ""reduced freshwater availability""
   
   The predicted effect is identical in meaning to the ground truth effect. The only difference is in capitalization, which does not affect the semantic meaning.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause, the addition of ""periods marked by"" does not alter the core concept significantly; hence, it can be considered a partial match or very close to an exact match because the essential cause is still conveyed."
row41,0.0,0.0,0.0,expansion of offshore wind farms reached commissioning milestones,increased renewable energy production,Expansion of offshore wind farms,Increased renewable energy production,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect components separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expansion of offshore wind farms""
   - Predicted Cause: ""expansion of offshore wind farms reached commissioning milestones""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of the ground truth cause (""expansion of offshore wind farms"") but adds additional detail (""reached commissioning milestones""). The core concept is preserved, but the addition changes the nuance of what is considered the cause. The ground truth cause focuses on the expansion itself, while the predicted cause specifies a particular aspect or condition related to that expansion (reaching commissioning milestones). This can be seen as adding a detail that isn't present in the ground truth, making it not an exact match but still related to the expansion.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased renewable energy production""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased renewable energy production""
   
   The predicted effect is identical in meaning to the ground truth effect. Both state ""increased renewable energy production"" without any difference in wording or implied meaning.

row42,0.0,0.0,0.0,construction,increased urban heat islands,Increased urban heat islands due to construction,Elevated energy consumption for cooling,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased urban heat islands due to construction""
   - Predicted Cause: ""construction""
   
   The ground truth cause mentions ""Increased urban heat islands due to construction,"" indicating that the actual cause is ""construction"" leading to an increase in urban heat islands. The predicted cause is ""construction,"" which is a part of the ground truth cause but doesn't directly state ""increased urban heat islands due to construction."" However, it captures the core initiating factor (""construction""). Thus, it's a partial representation because it doesn't include the effect of construction (i.e., increased urban heat islands). Therefore, the cause score should reflect that it's related but lacks the full context.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Elevated energy consumption for cooling""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased urban heat islands""
   
   The predicted effect (""increased urban heat islands"") is actually the intermediate cause or a step in the causal chain described in the ground truth. The ground truth effect is about ""Elevated energy consumption for cooling,"" which is a consequence of increased urban heat islands. The predicted effect is"
row43,0.0,0.0,0.0,habitat disruption,,Development of large-scale solar farms,Habitat disruption for wildlife,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Development of large-scale solar farms""
   - Predicted Cause: ""habitat disruption""
   
   The ground truth cause is about the development of large-scale solar farms, which is a specific human activity. The predicted cause is ""habitat disruption,"" which is actually listed as the effect in the ground truth pair. This indicates a mismatch because the predicted cause is not related to the activity (development of solar farms) but is instead the consequence of such activities. Therefore, the cause is not a match.

2. **Effect Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Habitat disruption for wildlife""
   - Predicted Effect: """" (empty)
   
   The ground truth effect is ""Habitat disruption for wildlife,"" which is a specific consequence. The predicted effect is empty, meaning there's no effect provided to compare against the ground truth. Thus, the effect cannot be considered a match because there is no predicted effect to evaluate.

Given these observations:

- For the cause: The predicted cause (""habitat disruption"") is actually the ground truth effect. Hence, it is not a correct cause, leading to a"
row44,0.0,0.0,0.0,intensive agriculture,severe soil erosion,Severe soil erosion due to intensive agriculture,Reduced land productivity,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Severe soil erosion due to intensive agriculture""
   - Predicted Cause: ""intensive agriculture""
   
   The ground truth cause mentions ""Severe soil erosion due to intensive agriculture,"" indicating that intensive agriculture is the cause of severe soil erosion. The predicted cause directly states ""intensive agriculture,"" which is a part of the ground truth cause but does not directly state the cause as ""severe soil erosion."" Instead, it identifies the root cause (intensive agriculture) mentioned in the ground truth. However, the actual cause in the ground truth is ""intensive agriculture,"" and the effect of it is ""severe soil erosion."" So, the predicted cause is actually the cause of the cause in the ground truth. The core concept (intensive agriculture) is captured, but it's used in a different context. Thus, it's a partial match because it identifies a crucial element (intensive agriculture) but not in the context of being the direct cause stated in the ground truth.

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduced land productivity""
   - Predicted Effect: """

1. **Cause Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased desalination plant operations""
   - Predicted Cause: ""increased brine discharge""
   
   The ground truth cause is about the operation of desalination plants, while the predicted cause is about the discharge resulting from those operations. Although they are related, ""increased desalination plant operations"" is the root cause, and ""increased brine discharge"" is a consequence of that root cause. Therefore, the predicted cause is not the original cause but a subsequent effect of the original cause.
