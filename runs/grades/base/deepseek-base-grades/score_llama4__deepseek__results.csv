1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Increased international trade tariffs""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""increased international trade tariffs and the broader economic environment""
   
   The predicted cause includes the exact phrase ""increased international trade tariffs"" found in the ground truth cause, which is a key element. However, it also adds ""and the broader economic environment,"" which introduces additional information not present in the ground truth cause. The core concept of ""increased international trade tariffs"" is maintained, but the addition of ""the broader economic environment"" slightly alters the focus by broadening the cause. Thus, the predicted cause is not an exact match but retains the core concept with additional detail. This suggests a partial match.

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Reduction in import-dependent industries' profitability""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""reduction in import-dependent industries' profitability""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect, both in wording and meaning. This indicates an exact match.

row5,0.0,0.0,0.0,remote work policies were widely adopted,reduced corporate real estate expenditures,Implementation of remote work policies,Reduced corporate real estate expenditures,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, we need to analyze both the cause and effect components separately and then score them according to the given scoring rules.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Implementation of remote work policies""
   - Predicted Cause: ""remote work policies were widely adopted""

   The ground truth cause mentions the ""implementation"" of remote work policies, which implies the act of putting these policies into effect. The predicted cause states that ""remote work policies were widely adopted,"" which conveys a similar idea - that remote work policies became commonly used or accepted. Although the wording is different, both causes convey the idea that remote work policies became a standard practice. Thus, they are semantically similar.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduced corporate real estate expenditures""
   - Predicted Effect: ""reduced corporate real estate expenditures""

   Both the ground truth and predicted effects are identical in meaning, as they both state that there was a reduction in corporate real estate expenditures. The wording is the same, just differing in case.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause: Since ""implementation"" and ""widely adopted"" convey a similar overall concept regarding remote work policies becoming effective or common, this can be"
row6,0.0,0.0,0.0,changes in data privacy laws,increase in compliance costs for businesses,Enhanced data privacy legislation,Increased compliance costs for businesses,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, we need to assess both the cause and effect components separately for their similarity in meaning.

1. **Cause Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Enhanced data privacy legislation""
   - Predicted Cause: ""changes in data privacy laws""
   
   Both phrases relate to alterations in the legal framework governing data privacy. ""Enhanced data privacy legislation"" implies a strengthening or improvement of laws related to data privacy, while ""changes in data privacy laws"" is more neutral, encompassing any kind of alteration (strengthening, weakening, or modifying). Despite the difference in wording and the nuance of ""enhanced"" versus ""changes,"" they both convey the idea of data privacy laws being modified. The core concept is similar, but ""changes"" is broader than ""enhanced."" Thus, it's a partial match because it captures the essence of a modification in data privacy laws but lacks the specific direction of the change (i.e., enhancement).

2. **Effect Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased compliance costs for businesses""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increase in compliance costs for businesses""
   
   The predicted effect and the ground truth effect are semantically identical. Both phrases convey that the cost for businesses to comply with"

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: Adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
   - Predicted Cause: adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
   
   The predicted cause is identical to the ground truth cause, with the only difference being the capitalization of the first letter. This is a trivial difference that does not affect the meaning. Therefore, the cause_score should be 1.0.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: Decline in traditional cash usage
   - Predicted Effect: changes in cash usage, which notably declined
   
   The predicted effect mentions ""changes in cash usage, which notably declined."" The phrase ""notably declined"" is semantically similar to ""decline,"" indicating a reduction. The addition of ""changes in cash usage"" before specifying that it ""notably declined"" implies that the decline is a change, which aligns with the ground truth effect of a ""decline in traditional cash usage."" The core concept of a decline in cash usage is preserved, and the addition of ""changes"" does not alter the fundamental meaning that cash usage has decreased. Therefore,"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expansion of financial literacy education""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the growing focus on financial knowledge""

   The ground truth cause talks about the ""expansion of financial literacy education,"" which implies an increase or spread in educational efforts related to financial literacy. The predicted cause mentions ""the growing focus on financial knowledge,"" which conveys a similar idea of an increasing emphasis on understanding financial concepts. Both phrases, while not identical, convey the idea of an increasing attention or effort towards improving financial understanding or literacy. Thus, they can be considered to have similar core concepts.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased household savings rates""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased household savings rates""

   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect, both stating ""increased household savings rates."" This indicates a perfect match in terms of the effect being described.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause: The core concept is similar (increasing financial literacy/knowledge), so it is not an exact match but conveys a similar idea. Hence"

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Sudden bankruptcy of major banks""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the sudden bankruptcy of major banks""
   
   The predicted cause includes the definite article ""the"" and is otherwise identical to the ground truth cause. The addition of ""the"" does not change the meaning; it merely specifies the subject. Thus, both causes are semantically identical.

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decline in investor confidence""
   - Predicted Effect: ""investor confidence appeared to decline""
   
   The ground truth effect states a fact (""Decline in investor confidence""), while the predicted effect phrases it as an observation (""investor confidence appeared to decline""). The core concept of a decline in investor confidence is present in both. The difference lies in the phrasing, where ""appeared to decline"" suggests a perception or observation of decline rather than a straightforward statement of decline. Despite this, the core concept remains similar.

Given these analyses:

- For the cause: The predicted cause is semantically identical to"
row13,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,Increased automation in financial auditing,Reduction in accounting errors,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, we need to assess both the cause and the effect individually based on the scoring rules provided.

1. **Cause Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased automation in financial auditing""
   - Predicted Cause: Not provided.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Surge in remote banking services""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the ongoing rise in remote banking services""
   
   Both causes refer to an increase in remote banking services. The terms ""surge"" and ""ongoing rise"" convey a similar meaning of an upward trend. Thus, they are semantically identical in the context of the cause.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decline in physical bank branch numbers""
   - Predicted Effect: ""physical bank branches saw a marked decline""
   
   Both effects talk about a decrease in the number of physical bank branches. The phrase ""Decline in physical bank branch numbers"" and ""physical bank branches saw a marked decline"" essentially convey the same meaning, with ""marked decline"" emphasizing the extent of the decline.

Given the analysis:
- The cause is semantically identical, so the cause score should be 1.0.
- The effect is also semantically identical, so the effect score should be 1.0.

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of AI-driven credit scoring""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the technology was linked to increased accuracy in loan approvals""
   
   The predicted cause mentions ""the technology,"" which can be interpreted as referring to ""AI-driven credit scoring"" since the context is about credit scoring and loan approvals. However, the phrase ""was linked to increased accuracy in loan approvals"" is more of a statement about the effect or the consequence of the technology rather than the cause itself. The actual cause in the predicted pair is somewhat ambiguous and does not directly state ""adoption"" but implies the existence or use of the technology. Thus, it's not a direct or exact match but captures a related concept. Therefore, it can be considered a partial match because it refers to the same general concept (AI-driven credit scoring) but phrases it in a way that describes its consequence rather than its adoption.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expanded use of blockchain in supply chain finance""
   - Predicted Cause: ""use of blockchain""
   
   The predicted cause captures the core concept of using blockchain but lacks specific details present in the ground truth cause, such as ""expanded"" and ""in supply chain finance"". The term ""expanded use"" suggests a growing or increasing application, which is somewhat implied by ""use"" but not as strongly. Additionally, ""in supply chain finance"" provides context that is missing in the predicted cause. Thus, while the core concept of ""blockchain use"" is present, important details are missing, making it a partial match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Improved transparency in transactions""
   - Predicted Effect: ""improved transparency in transactions""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect, both in wording and meaning. Therefore, it is an exact match.

The ground truth pair is:
- Cause: Reduction of foreign direct investment due to economic sanctions
- Effect: Slowed economic growth

The predicted pair is:
- Cause: sanctions, slowed economic growth
- Effect: reduction of foreign direct investment

First, let's break down the components:

1. **Cause in Ground Truth**: ""Reduction of foreign direct investment due to economic sanctions""
   - The cause here is a composite event involving ""economic sanctions"" leading to ""reduction of foreign direct investment.""

2. **Effect in Ground Truth**: ""Slowed economic growth""
   - This is the outcome of the cause mentioned above.

3. **Cause in Predicted Pair**: ""sanctions, slowed economic growth""
   - The predicted cause includes ""sanctions"" and ""slowed economic growth."" ""Sanctions"" is related to ""economic sanctions"" in the ground truth, so it's a partial match in terms of concept. However, ""slowed economic growth"" is the effect in the ground truth, not the cause.

4. **Effect in Predicted Pair**: ""reduction of foreign direct investment""
   - This is related to the cause in the ground truth, as it is """
row22,0.0,0.0,0.0,broader industry changes,,Increased corporate mergers and acquisitions,Reduction in market competition,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Increased corporate mergers and acquisitions""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""broader industry changes""

The ground truth cause specifically mentions ""Increased corporate mergers and acquisitions"" as the cause. The predicted cause is ""broader industry changes."" Corporate mergers and acquisitions can be considered a part of broader industry changes, as they represent significant restructuring or consolidation within an industry. However, ""broader industry changes"" is a more general term that could encompass a wide range of changes beyond just mergers and acquisitions, such as technological advancements, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer behavior. Therefore, while there is some overlap, the predicted cause is not as specific as the ground truth cause. This suggests a partial match because the core concept of significant industry alterations is similar, but the predicted cause lacks the specificity of the ground truth.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Reduction in market competition""
   - **Predicted Effect**: Not provided (empty)

Since the predicted effect is not provided, it cannot be compared to the ground truth effect. Therefore, it is considered a non-match or incorrect in"

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Strengthened anti-money laundering policies""
   - Predicted Cause: ""strengthened regulations""
   
   The ground truth cause specifically mentions ""anti-money laundering policies,"" which is a particular type of regulation. The predicted cause, ""strengthened regulations,"" is broader and encompasses not just anti-money laundering policies but any regulations that are strengthened. Although ""anti-money laundering policies"" are a subset of ""regulations,"" the predicted cause lacks the specificity of the ground truth cause. Therefore, it's a partial match because it captures the general idea of strengthening policies/regulations but misses the specific context of ""anti-money laundering.""

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased administrative overhead for banks""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased administrative overhead""
   
   The predicted effect captures the core concept of ""increased administrative overhead,"" which is present in the ground truth effect. However, it omits the detail ""for banks."" The ground truth effect specifies that the increased administrative overhead is particularly for banks"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Shift towards digital payment systems""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the shift toward digital payment systems accelerated""

   The ground truth cause mentions a ""shift towards digital payment systems,"" which implies a movement or change towards using digital payments more. The predicted cause states ""the shift toward digital payment systems accelerated,"" indicating not just a shift, but an acceleration of this shift. Both causes convey the idea of moving towards digital payment systems, but the predicted cause adds the notion of acceleration. Despite this difference, the core concept of shifting towards digital payments is present in both. Thus, the predicted cause captures the essence of the ground truth cause but with additional detail (acceleration). This can be considered a partial match because the core concept is similar, but the predicted cause includes an important detail (acceleration) not present in the ground truth.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Increased frequency of forest fires""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""increased frequency of forest fires in the region, an uptick in recreational land use and an unusual sequence of dry lightning storms""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""increased frequency of forest fires,"" which matches the ground truth cause. However, it adds more details and other factors (""in the region,"" ""an uptick in recreational land use,"" and ""an unusual sequence of dry lightning storms""). The addition of these details and extra causes means it's not a straightforward exact match but includes the core concept.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Extensive deforestation in tropical regions""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""extensive deforestation in tropical regions, amid concurrently shifting monsoon tracks and aerosol emissions""
   
   The predicted cause includes the exact phrase as the ground truth cause (""extensive deforestation in tropical regions""), which means it captures the core concept. However, it adds additional details (""amid concurrently shifting monsoon tracks and aerosol emissions"") not present in the ground truth cause. The core concept of ""extensive deforestation in tropical regions"" is preserved, but the addition of other factors makes it more detailed than the ground truth. Since the core cause is still ""extensive deforestation in tropical regions,"" this can be considered a partial match because the additional details, while relevant, are not part of the ground truth cause.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Reduction in regional rainfall""

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased microplastic pollution""
   - Predicted Cause: ""elevated currents of increased microplastic pollution""

The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""increased microplastic pollution,"" which matches the ground truth cause. However, it adds an additional detail, ""elevated currents of,"" which is not present in the ground truth cause. The addition of ""elevated currents of"" suggests a specific mechanism or condition under which microplastic pollution is considered, potentially implying the transportation or distribution of microplastics. Despite this addition, the core concept of ""increased microplastic pollution"" remains intact. Therefore, the predicted cause is not an exact match but retains the core concept with additional detail. This suggests a partial match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decline in marine life populations""
   - Predicted Effect: ""a decline in marine life populations""

The predicted effect is semantically identical to the ground truth effect. The addition of the indefinite article ""a"" does not change the meaning. Both effects convey the same outcome regarding marine life populations.

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Intensified hurricane activity""
   - Predicted Cause: ""seasons of intensified hurricane activity""

The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""intensified hurricane activity"" but adds ""seasons of."" The addition of ""seasons of"" provides a temporal context, suggesting periods or specific times when hurricane activity is intensified. Despite this addition, the fundamental cause, ""intensified hurricane activity,"" remains the central idea. The core concept is still about intensified hurricane activity, so it's not entirely different, but it does add a nuance by specifying it occurs in seasons.

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of electric vehicles""
   - Predicted Cause: ""large‑scale adoption of electric vehicles""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""adoption of electric vehicles"" but adds the detail ""large‑scale."" While this adds a specific condition to the adoption, it doesn't change the fundamental cause. The core concept remains the same, but the addition of ""large‑scale"" could be considered an important detail. Thus, it's a partial match because it specifies a scale that isn't present in the ground truth.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduction in urban air pollution""
   - Predicted Effect: ""reduction in urban air pollution on transit corridors""
   
   The predicted effect contains the core concept of ""reduction in urban air pollution,"" which matches the ground truth effect. However, it adds a specific detail ""on transit corridors,"" which narrows down the scope of the effect. This addition is an important detail as it specifies where the reduction occurs. Thus, it's a partial match because it includes additional specificity not present in the ground truth.

1. **Cause Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Extensive fertilizer runoff""
   - Predicted Cause: ""extensive fertilizer runoff""
   The predicted cause is identical to the ground truth cause, except for the case difference, which does not affect the meaning. Therefore, the cause is considered an exact match.

2. **Effect Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems""
   - Predicted Effect: ""Increased eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems downstream""
   The predicted effect includes the core concept of ""increased eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems,"" which matches the ground truth effect. However, it adds ""downstream,"" which provides additional detail about the location of the aquatic ecosystems affected. The addition of ""downstream"" does not change the core concept but adds a detail that is implicitly related to the context of fertilizer runoff. The core concept remains the same.

Given these observations:

- The cause is an exact match, so ""cause_score"" should be 1.
- The effect has the same core concept but includes additional detail (""downstream""). This can be considered a partial addition rather"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Rapid glacial retreat in mountainous regions""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""reduced freshwater availability during periods marked by rapid glacial retreat in mountainous regions""
   
   The predicted cause includes the ground truth cause (""rapid glacial retreat in mountainous regions"") but adds a condition related to ""reduced freshwater availability."" The ground truth cause is about the event (glacial retreat), while the predicted cause embeds this event within a consequence (reduced freshwater availability). Thus, the predicted cause is not a direct match but contains the core concept of the ground truth cause. However, it adds an additional layer (the effect of glacial retreat) making it not entirely a cause but a mix of cause and effect. Hence, it's not a straightforward match.

The ground truth cause focuses on the increased use or dependence on telemedicine. In contrast, the predicted cause discusses aspects (quality of care and infrastructure) related to telemedicine but does not directly relate to the concept of ""increased reliance"" on it. While telemedicine is a common subject, the core concept of the cause is different. The predicted cause is more about the prerequisites or factors influencing effective telemedicine rather than the reliance on it. Hence, it is not a direct match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Improved access to healthcare services""
   - Predicted Effect: ""critical points of evaluation""

The ground truth effect is about the positive outcome of increased telemedicine usage, specifically improving access to healthcare.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Widespread use of open-source software""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the growth of open-source software""
   
   The ground truth cause mentions ""widespread use,"" while the predicted cause talks about ""the growth."" Both phrases convey the idea of open-source software becoming more prevalent or significant. ""Widespread use"" and ""growth"" can be considered related concepts, as growth can lead to or imply widespread use. Thus, they share a similar core concept regarding the increasing importance or prevalence of open-source software.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Accelerated innovation in technology communities""
   - Predicted Effect: ""innovation by allowing collaborative development across various tech communities""
   
   The ground truth effect is about ""accelerated innovation,"" while the predicted effect mentions ""innovation"" facilitated by collaborative development. The idea of acceleration is not explicitly mentioned in the predicted effect, but ""allowing collaborative development"" implies a positive impact on innovation, potentially accelerating it. Both effects are centered around the concept of innovation within tech or technology communities.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Enhanced GPU computational capabilities""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""the demand for even faster and more specialized hardware""
   
   The ground truth cause focuses on the enhancement of GPU capabilities, which is a specific technological advancement. The predicted cause talks about the demand for faster and more specialized hardware, which is related to but not directly the same as enhanced GPU capabilities. The demand for faster hardware can drive the development of enhanced GPU capabilities, so there's a related concept, but they are not the same thing. The predicted cause is more about the driving force behind the enhancement rather than the enhancement itself. Thus, it's a partial match because it relates to the context in which enhanced GPU capabilities might occur, but it doesn't directly state the same thing.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Improved performance in AI training tasks""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""continues to push the boundaries of current GPU technology""

row75,0.0,0.0,0.0,their adoption grows,companies are realizing the potential for increased efficiency,Increased application of digital twins in manufacturing,Optimized operational efficiency,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased application of digital twins in manufacturing""
   - Predicted Cause: ""their adoption grows""
   
   The term ""their"" in the predicted cause refers back to a subject that should be related to the context of the ground truth cause. If we consider ""digital twins"" as the subject ""their"" is referring to, then ""their adoption grows"" can be seen as related to ""Increased application of digital twins in manufacturing"". Both phrases convey the idea of digital twins being more widely used or adopted. Thus, they share a similar core concept regarding the increasing use or adoption of digital twins. Therefore, the cause can be considered a partial match because it captures the essence of increasing adoption but lacks specific details about the context (i.e., ""in manufacturing"").

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Optimized operational efficiency""
   - Predicted Effect: ""companies are realizing the potential for increased efficiency""
   
   Both effects relate to the concept of ""efficiency"". The ground truth effect mentions ""optimized operational efficiency"", implying that the efficiency is not just increased but optimized. The"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Enhanced encryption standards for mobile devices""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""the evolving nature of cyber threats""

The ground truth cause focuses on a specific action or measure (enhanced encryption standards) taken to improve security. In contrast, the predicted cause refers to a broader, ongoing phenomenon (the evolving nature of cyber threats) that drives the need for security measures. While the predicted cause is related to why enhanced encryption might be necessary, it doesn't directly match the specific action described in the ground truth cause. Thus, it's not a direct or semantically identical match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Strengthened personal data protection""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""innovation in mobile security technologies""

The ground truth effect is about the outcome of a specific security measure (enhanced encryption standards), which is to strengthen personal data protection. The predicted effect, however, talks about the result of the evolving cyber threats, which is innovation in mobile security technologies.
