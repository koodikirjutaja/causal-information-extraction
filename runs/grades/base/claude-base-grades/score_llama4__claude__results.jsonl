Despite the difference in specificity and the direction of change, they share the core concept of data privacy laws being modified.

The terms \"expansion\" and \"growing focus\" both indicate an increase or heightened emphasis on the subject. Therefore, while not identical, they convey a very similar idea.

The predicted cause simply states \"Software-defined networking (SDN)\" without explicitly mentioning \"adoption.\" However, the core concept of SDN is present in both. The difference lies in the nuance of whether SDN is being adopted or is simply the technology in question. Despite this, the essential element, \"SDN,\" is the same, and the context implies that the adoption or use of SDN is what's being referred to.
