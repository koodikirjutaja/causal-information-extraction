1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Increased international trade tariffs""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""increased international trade tariffs and the broader economic environment""
   
   The predicted cause includes the exact phrase ""increased international trade tariffs"" found in the ground truth cause, which is a key element. However, it also adds ""and the broader economic environment,"" which introduces additional information not present in the ground truth cause. The core concept of ""increased international trade tariffs"" is maintained, but the addition of ""the broader economic environment"" slightly alters the focus by broadening the cause beyond just tariffs.

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Reduction in import-dependent industries' profitability""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""reduction in import-dependent industries' profitability""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect, both in terms of wording and meaning. This indicates a perfect match.

Given the analysis:

- For the **cause**, the core concept is similar, but the predicted cause includes additional information (""the broader economic environment"") not in the ground truth. Thus, it's not"
row4,0.0,0.0,0.0,the rise in ESG investing standards caught attention,Numerous alternative explanations were proposed,Rise in ESG investing standards,Growth in sustainable investment funds,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Rise in ESG investing standards""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""the rise in ESG investing standards caught attention""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of the ground truth cause (""rise in ESG investing standards"") but adds an additional detail (""caught attention""). The core concept is still present, but the addition changes the nuance of what is being caused. However, the fundamental cause (""rise in ESG investing standards"") is still identifiable. Thus, it's a partial match because it retains the core concept but adds a condition (""caught attention"") not present in the ground truth.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Growth in sustainable investment funds""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""Numerous alternative explanations were proposed""
   
   The predicted effect is quite different from the ground truth effect. The ground truth effect is about a specific outcome (""Growth in sustainable investment funds""), whereas the predicted effect is about a reaction or response (""Numerous alternative explanations were proposed"") that doesn't directly relate to the growth or outcome expected in the ground truth. Thus, it is not a"
row5,0.0,0.0,0.0,remote work policies were widely adopted,reduced corporate real estate expenditures occurred,Implementation of remote work policies,Reduced corporate real estate expenditures,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Implementation of remote work policies""
   - Predicted Cause: ""remote work policies were widely adopted""

The ground truth cause mentions the ""implementation"" of remote work policies, which implies putting these policies into effect. The predicted cause states that ""remote work policies were widely adopted,"" which conveys a similar idea - that these policies were not just implemented but also accepted or used on a large scale. Although the wording is slightly different, both causes convey the idea of remote work policies being put into practice. The core concept is similar, and the difference is more about the nuance of the implementation versus adoption. Thus, the predicted cause can be considered to have a similar meaning to the ground truth cause.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduced corporate real estate expenditures""
   - Predicted Effect: ""reduced corporate real estate expenditures occurred""

The ground truth effect is about the reduction in corporate real estate expenditures. The predicted effect states that ""reduced corporate real estate expenditures occurred,"" which is semantically identical to the ground truth effect. Both indicate a decrease or reduction in corporate real estate expenditures."
row6,0.0,0.0,0.0,changes in data privacy laws,enhanced data privacy legislation emerged,Enhanced data privacy legislation,Increased compliance costs for businesses,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Enhanced data privacy legislation""
   - Predicted Cause: ""changes in data privacy laws""

   Both phrases relate to alterations or updates in the legal framework governing data privacy. ""Enhanced data privacy legislation"" implies a strengthening or improvement of laws related to data privacy, while ""changes in data privacy laws"" is more general, encompassing any kind of alteration (not limited to enhancements). Despite the difference in specificity and the direction of change, they share the core concept of data privacy laws being modified. Thus, they can be considered to have a similar core concept, but the predicted cause lacks the specificity of the ground truth cause regarding the direction of the change (i.e., ""enhanced""). Therefore, the cause can be scored as 0.5 because it's a partial match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased compliance costs for businesses""
   - Predicted Effect: ""enhanced data privacy legislation emerged""

   The ground truth effect discusses the consequence of the cause on businesses, specifically an increase in compliance costs. The predicted effect, however, refers back to the cause (""enh"
row7,0.0,0.0,0.0,adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs),"cash usage, which notably declined during the same period",Adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs),Decline in traditional cash usage,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: Adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
   - Predicted Cause: adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
   
   The predicted cause is identical to the ground truth cause. Both refer to the adoption of CBDCs as the cause. Therefore, the cause_score should be 1.0 as it is an exact match.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: Decline in traditional cash usage
   - Predicted Effect: cash usage, which notably declined during the same period
   
   The predicted effect mentions ""cash usage"" declining, which is semantically similar to a ""decline in traditional cash usage."" The core concept of cash usage declining is captured in both the ground truth and the predicted effect. Although the predicted effect adds ""during the same period,"" which might imply a temporal relationship or coincidence rather than a direct causal effect, the essential meaning of cash usage declining is preserved. Therefore, the effect_score should be considered 1.0 because the core concept is maintained, and the additional phrase, while adding some nuance, does not alter the"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expansion of financial literacy education""
   - Predicted Cause: ""The growing focus on financial knowledge""

Both causes relate to the idea of increasing or enhancing financial understanding or education among individuals. ""Financial literacy education"" and ""financial knowledge"" are closely related concepts, as financial literacy is essentially about having knowledge regarding financial matters. The terms ""expansion"" and ""growing focus"" both indicate an increase or heightened emphasis on the subject. Therefore, while not identical, they convey a very similar idea. The core concept is similar, and the difference is not significant enough to be considered a partial match; it's more aligned with being semantically identical in the context of cause.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased household savings rates""
   - Predicted Effect: ""coincided with increased household savings rates""

The predicted effect and the ground truth effect both mention ""increased household savings rates."" The phrase ""coincided with"" in the predicted effect suggests a temporal relationship or correlation rather than directly stating causation. However, the core effect (""increased household savings rates"") is"
row11,0.0,0.0,0.0,fintech grew,improved access to credit for small businesses was observed,Growth of fintech lending platforms,Improved access to credit for small businesses,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, we need to assess both the cause and effect components separately for their similarity in meaning.

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Growth of fintech lending platforms""
   - Predicted: ""fintech grew""

The ground truth cause mentions the ""growth of fintech lending platforms,"" which implies an expansion or increase in fintech, specifically in the context of lending platforms. The predicted cause, ""fintech grew,"" captures the essence of growth or expansion in fintech but lacks the specificity of ""lending platforms."" Despite this, the core concept of ""growth"" or ""expansion"" in ""fintech"" is present in both. Thus, while not exact, there's a significant similarity.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Improved access to credit for small businesses""
   - Predicted: ""improved access to credit for small businesses was observed""

The predicted effect is essentially the same as the ground truth effect, with the addition of ""was observed."" The core statement, ""improved access to credit for small businesses,"" is identical in meaning. The phrase ""was observed"" indicates a passive voice construction and does not alter the core effect; it merely suggests that the effect was noted or observed."
row12,0.0,0.0,0.0,the sudden bankruptcy of major banks,investor confidence appeared to decline,Sudden bankruptcy of major banks,Decline in investor confidence,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect components separately.

1. **Cause Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Sudden bankruptcy of major banks""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the sudden bankruptcy of major banks""
   
   The predicted cause and the ground truth cause are essentially the same, with the only difference being the addition of the definite article ""the"" in the predicted cause. The core concept, ""sudden bankruptcy of major banks,"" is identical in both. Therefore, the cause is considered an exact match or semantically identical in meaning.

2. **Effect Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decline in investor confidence""
   - Predicted Effect: ""investor confidence appeared to decline""
   
   The ground truth effect states ""Decline in investor confidence,"" while the predicted effect states ""investor confidence appeared to decline."" Both convey the same core concept that investor confidence decreased. The difference lies in the phrasing; the predicted effect uses ""appeared to decline,"" which slightly softens the assertion compared to a direct ""decline."" However, the essential meaning remains the same, as both indicate a reduction in investor confidence.

Given these observations:

- For the cause: The addition"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Surge in remote banking services""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the ongoing rise in remote banking services""
   
   Both causes refer to an increase in remote banking services. The terms ""surge"" and ""ongoing rise"" convey a similar meaning of an upward trend. The core concept is the same, and the difference is mainly in the wording. Thus, they are semantically identical in meaning regarding the context of the cause.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decline in physical bank branch numbers""
   - Predicted Effect: ""physical bank branches saw a marked decline""
   
   Both effects talk about a decrease in physical bank branches. The phrase ""Decline in physical bank branch numbers"" and ""physical bank branches saw a marked decline"" essentially convey the same idea. The term ""marked"" adds a nuance indicating the decline was significant, but the core concept of a decline is maintained. Thus, they are also semantically similar.

Given the analysis, both the cause and effect components of the predicted pair are semantically identical to their counterparts in the ground"

1. **Cause Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of AI-driven credit scoring""
   - Predicted Cause: ""The shift toward AI-driven credit scoring""
   
   Both causes refer to the transition or movement towards using AI-driven credit scoring. The terms ""adoption"" and ""shift toward"" convey a similar meaning in this context, indicating a change or movement towards AI-driven credit scoring. Therefore, they are semantically identical in meaning regarding the context of changing to AI-driven credit scoring.

2. **Effect Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased accuracy in loan approvals""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased accuracy in loan approvals""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect. Both state ""increased accuracy in loan approvals,"" indicating no difference in meaning.

Given the analysis:
- The cause is semantically identical (Score: 1.0) because ""adoption"" and ""shift toward"" both imply a movement towards AI-driven credit scoring.
- The effect is an exact match (Score: 1.0) as both the ground truth and predicted effects are identical.

Therefore, the scoring should reflect that"

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Supply chain disruptions due to pandemics""
   - Predicted: ""supply chain disruptions due to pandemics""
   
   The cause in both the ground truth and the predicted pair is identical in terms of wording and meaning. The difference in case (lowercase vs. capitalized first letter) is not significant for the semantic meaning. Therefore, the cause_score should be 1.0 as it is an exact match.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Inflationary pressures on consumer goods""
   - Predicted: ""inflationary pressures on consumer goods were observed""
   
   The core concept of the effect in both pairs is the same, which is ""inflationary pressures on consumer goods."" The predicted effect adds the phrase ""were observed,"" which indicates the occurrence or observation of the effect but does not change the core concept or meaning of the effect itself. The addition of ""were observed"" can be seen as providing a slightly different nuance (focusing on the observation rather than the state itself), but it does not alter the fundamental meaning. Thus, the effect_score can be considered 1"

1. **Cause Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Reduction of foreign direct investment due to economic sanctions""
   - Predicted Cause: ""sanctions""
   
   The predicted cause ""sanctions"" is a part of the ground truth cause. The ground truth cause is ""Reduction of foreign direct investment due to economic sanctions,"" which implies that ""economic sanctions"" led to a reduction in foreign direct investment. The predicted cause directly mentions ""sanctions,"" which can be considered a shortened form or a core concept of ""economic sanctions."" Thus, while it doesn't capture the full nuance (i.e., the effect of sanctions on foreign direct investment), it captures the core concept that leads to the effect in the ground truth. Therefore, it's a partial match because it doesn't directly convey the reduction aspect but implies the cause (sanctions) that leads to the reduction.

2. **Effect Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Slowed economic growth""
   - Predicted Effect: ""reduction of foreign direct investment""
   
   The predicted effect is ""reduction of foreign direct investment,"" which is actually the cause in the ground truth pair. The ground truth effect"
row22,0.0,0.0,0.0,The rise in corporate mergers and acquisitions,market competition decreased,Increased corporate mergers and acquisitions,Reduction in market competition,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased corporate mergers and acquisitions""
   - Predicted Cause: ""The rise in corporate mergers and acquisitions""
   
   Both causes refer to the same phenomenon - an increase in corporate mergers and acquisitions. The terms ""Increased"" and ""The rise in"" convey the same meaning, which is an upward trend. Therefore, the predicted cause is semantically identical to the ground truth cause.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduction in market competition""
   - Predicted Effect: ""market competition decreased""
   
   Both effects indicate a decrease in market competition. ""Reduction in market competition"" and ""market competition decreased"" are semantically identical as they both convey the same outcome - a decline in the level of competition within the market.

Given the analysis, both the cause and effect of the predicted pair are semantically identical to their respective ground truth components.

- For the cause: Score = 1.0
- For the effect: Score = 1.0

Therefore, the JSON response should reflect that both components match exactly in terms of semantic meaning.

row23,0.0,0.0,0.0,strengthened regulations,increased administrative overhead,Strengthened anti-money laundering policies,Increased administrative overhead for banks,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Strengthened anti-money laundering policies""
   - Predicted Cause: ""strengthened regulations""
   
   The ground truth cause specifically mentions ""anti-money laundering policies,"" which is a particular type of regulation. The predicted cause, ""strengthened regulations,"" is broader and encompasses not just anti-money laundering policies but any regulations that are strengthened. While ""anti-money laundering policies"" are a subset of ""regulations,"" the predicted cause is not as specific. Thus, it's a partial match because it captures the general idea of strengthening rules but lacks the specificity of the type of regulations.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased administrative overhead for banks""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased administrative overhead""
   
   The predicted effect captures the core concept of ""increased administrative overhead,"" which is present in the ground truth effect. However, it misses the detail that this effect is specifically ""for banks."" Despite this, the core concept of increased administrative overhead is maintained, making it a partial match.

1. **Cause Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expansion of urban areas""
   - Predicted Cause: ""rapid expansion of urban areas""
   
   The predicted cause includes the word ""rapid,"" which adds a detail about the speed of the expansion. The core concept of ""expansion of urban areas"" is maintained in both the ground truth and the predicted cause. The addition of ""rapid"" does not change the fundamental meaning but adds a descriptor. Thus, the core concept is similar, and the addition does not alter the basic cause-effect relationship. Therefore, the cause can be considered as having a semantically identical meaning with a slight variation that doesn't change the core concept.

2. **Effect Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Loss of wetlands""
   - Predicted Effect: ""loss of wetlands""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect, with only a difference in case (""Loss"" vs ""loss""). The meaning remains the same.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased microplastic pollution""
   - Predicted Cause: ""elevated currents of increased microplastic pollution""

The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""increased microplastic pollution,"" which matches the ground truth cause. However, it adds an additional detail, ""elevated currents of,"" which is not present in the ground truth cause. The addition of ""elevated currents of"" suggests a specific mechanism or condition under which microplastic pollution is considered, potentially implying the transport or distribution of microplastics. Despite this addition, the core concept of ""increased microplastic pollution"" remains intact. Therefore, the predicted cause is not an exact match but retains the core concept with additional detail. This suggests a partial match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decline in marine life populations""

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Implementation of plastic bag bans""
   - Predicted Cause: ""implementation of plastic bag bans""
   
   The predicted cause is identical to the ground truth cause, with the only difference being the capitalization. Since capitalization does not change the meaning, the causes are considered to have an exact match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduction in plastic waste""
   - Predicted Effect: ""reduction in plastic waste in areas""
   
   The core concept of both effects is the ""reduction in plastic waste."" The predicted effect adds ""in areas,"" which provides additional detail but does not alter the core concept. The addition of ""in areas"" could be seen as specifying the context or location of the reduction, but it doesn't change the fundamental effect being described. Thus, the core concept remains similar, but there is some additional detail.

Given these observations:

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of electric vehicles""
   - Predicted Cause: ""large‑scale adoption of electric vehicles""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""adoption of electric vehicles"" but adds the detail ""large‑scale."" While the addition of ""large‑scale"" provides more specificity, it doesn't change the fundamental cause. The core concept remains the same, but the added detail could be considered important for the scale of the effect.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expansion of offshore wind farms""
   - Predicted Cause: ""expansion of offshore wind farms reached commissioning milestones""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""expansion of offshore wind farms"" but adds an additional detail ""reached commissioning milestones."" The core concept is the same, but the predicted cause provides more specific information about the stage or status of the expansion. Despite this addition, the fundamental cause (expansion of offshore wind farms) is still captured. Thus, it can be considered a partial match because it retains the core concept but with additional detail.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased renewable energy production""
