row0,0.0,0.0,0.0,market analysts noticed an unusual pattern,the financial sector experienced shifts,Central bank raises interest rates,Consumer borrowing decreases,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Central bank raises interest rates"" is about a specific action taken by a central bank that affects interest rates.
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""market analysts noticed an unusual pattern"" refers to the observation of an unusual trend by market analysts, which doesn't directly relate to the action of a central bank raising interest rates.
   - The predicted cause doesn't directly match or convey the same meaning as the ground truth cause. They are related to different events or actions. Hence, the cause score should reflect a lack of direct semantic similarity or relevance.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Consumer borrowing decreases"" is a specific outcome related to the reduction in borrowing by consumers, likely as a result of increased interest rates.
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""the financial sector experienced shifts"" is a broad statement indicating changes or movements within the financial sector, without specifying what those shifts are.
   - While both effects are related to the financial domain, the predicted effect is too broad and doesn't directly convey the specific outcome of ""consumer borrowing decreases."" Thus, it doesn't match the ground truth effect"

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Increased international trade tariffs""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""increased international trade tariffs and the broader economic environment""
   
   The predicted cause includes the exact phrase ""increased international trade tariffs"" found in the ground truth cause, which is a key element. However, it also adds ""and the broader economic environment,"" introducing an additional factor not present in the ground truth cause. The core concept of ""increased international trade tariffs"" is maintained, but the addition of ""the broader economic environment"" adds a detail not in the ground truth. Thus, the predicted cause is not an exact match but captures the core concept with an additional detail. This suggests a partial match.

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Reduction in import-dependent industries' profitability""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""reduction in import-dependent industries' profitability""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect, both in terms of wording and meaning. This indicates an exact match.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Rise in ESG investing standards""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""the rise in ESG investing standards caught attention""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of the ground truth cause (""rise in ESG investing standards"") but adds an additional detail (""caught attention""). The core concept is still about the ""rise in ESG investing standards,"" so it is related, but the addition changes the nuance. Thus, it's not an exact match but shares the core concept.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Growth in sustainable investment funds""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""Numerous alternative explanations were proposed""
   
   The predicted effect is quite different from the ground truth effect. The ground truth effect is about a specific outcome (""Growth in sustainable investment funds""), while the predicted effect is about a reaction or response (""Numerous alternative explanations were proposed""). These are not similar in meaning.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause, since it includes the core concept but with an additional detail that changes the nuance, it could be considered a partial match. Thus, """
row5,0.0,0.0,0.0,reduced corporate real estate expenditures occurred alongside other factors,a complex scenario,Implementation of remote work policies,Reduced corporate real estate expenditures,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both.

**Ground Truth Pair:**
- Cause: Implementation of remote work policies
- Effect: Reduced corporate real estate expenditures

**Predicted Pair:**
- Cause: reduced corporate real estate expenditures occurred alongside other factors
- Effect: a complex scenario

The predicted cause is ""reduced corporate real estate expenditures occurred alongside other factors,"" which is not a direct match to the ground truth cause ""Implementation of remote work policies."" However, the ground truth effect ""Reduced corporate real estate expenditures"" is part of the predicted cause, indicating a partial connection. The predicted cause introduces ""other factors,"" which is not present in the ground truth cause, making it not entirely accurate. Thus, the cause is not a direct or semantically identical match; it is more of a rearrangement and addition. Hence, the cause score should be 0.0 because it doesn't directly match or convey the same meaning as the ground truth cause.

The predicted effect is ""a complex scenario,"" which is very vague and does not directly correspond to ""Reduced corporate real estate expenditures."" The ground truth effect is specific, while the predicted effect is too general and doesn't convey the same meaning. Therefore, the effect score should also be 0.0"
row6,0.0,0.0,0.0,broader legal shifts,the increase in compliance costs for businesses,Enhanced data privacy legislation,Increased compliance costs for businesses,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect components separately.

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Enhanced data privacy legislation""
   - Predicted Cause: ""broader legal shifts""

The ground truth cause specifically mentions ""Enhanced data privacy legislation,"" which implies a change or strengthening in laws related to data privacy. The predicted cause, ""broader legal shifts,"" is more general and could encompass changes in various legal areas, including data privacy legislation. While ""broader legal shifts"" could include ""Enhanced data privacy legislation,"" it is not as specific. Therefore, the predicted cause captures the general idea but lacks the specificity of the ground truth cause. This suggests a partial match.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased compliance costs for businesses""
   - Predicted Effect: ""the increase in compliance costs for businesses""

The ground truth effect and the predicted effect are very similar in meaning. Both refer to an increase in costs that businesses must bear to comply with certain regulations or laws. The difference is mainly in wording (""Increased"" vs. ""the increase in""), which does not change the core meaning. Thus, the predicted effect is semantically identical to the ground truth effect."

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth: Adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
   - Predicted: adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
   - The cause in both the ground truth and the predicted pair is identical in terms of wording and meaning. Therefore, the cause_score should be 1.0.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth: Decline in traditional cash usage
   - Predicted: changes in cash usage, which notably declined during the same period
   - The predicted effect mentions ""changes in cash usage"" and specifies that it ""notably declined,"" which conveys the same core meaning as a ""decline in traditional cash usage."" The phrase ""during the same period"" implies a temporal relationship but doesn't alter the core effect of a decline. Thus, the predicted effect is semantically very similar to the ground truth effect, capturing the essence of a decline in cash usage. Therefore, the effect_score should be 1.0.

Given the analysis, both the cause and effect components of the predicted pair match the ground truth pair with a high degree of semantic similarity.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Escalation of geopolitical tensions""
   - Predicted Cause: ""escalation of geopolitical tensions emerged""

The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""escalation of geopolitical tensions,"" which is identical to the ground truth cause. The addition of the word ""emerged"" in the predicted cause does not alter the core meaning related to the escalation of geopolitical tensions. It merely indicates the occurrence or appearance of this escalation. Thus, the core concept is preserved, and the addition does not change the fundamental meaning.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased prices of commodities such as oil""
   - Predicted Effect: ""Increased prices of commodities such as oil""

The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect. Both mention ""Increased prices of commodities such as oil,"" indicating a perfect match in terms of the effect.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause, since the core concept is the same and ""emerged"" doesn't change the essential meaning, it's considered a semantically identical meaning. Hence, **cause_score = 1**.
- For the effect, since it's"
row9,1.0,1.0,1.0,rising inflation rates,decreased consumer purchasing power,Rising inflation rates,Decrease in consumer purchasing power,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, we need to compare both the cause and the effect.

1. **Cause Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Rising inflation rates""
   - Predicted Cause: ""rising inflation rates""
   Both causes are identical in meaning; the difference is only in case (lowercase vs. capitalized). Thus, they are semantically identical.

2. **Effect Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decrease in consumer purchasing power""
   - Predicted Effect: ""decreased consumer purchasing power""
   Similar to the cause, the effect is also identical in meaning. The predicted effect uses ""decreased"" (a verb) instead of ""Decrease"" (a noun), but the meaning remains the same. ""Decreased consumer purchasing power"" is a state resulting from a decrease, and both expressions convey the same core concept.

Given the comparisons, both the cause and effect are semantically identical to their respective ground truth counterparts.

Therefore, the scoring should reflect an exact match or semantically identical meaning for both cause and effect.

row10,0.0,0.0,0.0,the expansion of financial literacy education,expressed mixed opinions,Expansion of financial literacy education,Increased household savings rates,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and the effect separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expansion of financial literacy education""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the expansion of financial literacy education""
   
   The predicted cause and the ground truth cause are essentially the same, with the only difference being the addition of the definite article ""the"" in the predicted cause. This minor difference does not change the meaning or the core concept of the cause. Therefore, the cause is considered to have an **exact match** or **semantically identical meaning**.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased household savings rates""
   - Predicted Effect: ""expressed mixed opinions""
   
   The predicted effect (""expressed mixed opinions"") and the ground truth effect (""Increased household savings rates"") are not related in terms of meaning. The ground truth effect refers to a specific outcome (increase in household savings rates) that is expected as a result of the cause. In contrast, the predicted effect refers to a reaction or opinion (mixed opinions) that does not directly relate to the outcome described in the ground truth. Therefore, the effect is considered to have **no match**.

1. **Cause Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Growth of fintech lending platforms""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""fintech grew""
   
   The predicted cause, ""fintech grew,"" captures the essence of the growth or expansion in the fintech sector, which is similar to the ""Growth of fintech lending platforms."" Although the predicted cause is not as specific as the ground truth (since it doesn't explicitly mention ""lending platforms""), it still conveys the core concept of fintech experiencing growth. Therefore, it can be considered a partial match because it doesn't specify that the growth is in ""lending platforms,"" but it implies an overall growth that could encompass lending.

2. **Effect Component Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Improved access to credit for small businesses""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""improved access to credit for small businesses was observed amidst these dynamics""
   
   The predicted effect, ""improved access to credit for small businesses was observed amidst these dynamics,"" essentially conveys the same outcome as the ground truth effect, which is ""Improved access to credit for small businesses."" The addition of ""was observed amidst these dynamics"""
row12,0.0,0.0,0.0,a number of complex and simultaneous events,the overall economic situation was shaped,Sudden bankruptcy of major banks,Decline in investor confidence,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Sudden bankruptcy of major banks"" is a specific event that implies a significant and sudden financial crisis.
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""a number of complex and simultaneous events"" is more general and does not specify the nature of these events. While it acknowledges multiple events happening at the same time, it doesn't directly imply a financial crisis or specifically mention banks.

   The predicted cause is not a direct match for the ground truth cause. The ground truth cause is specific to the banking sector and implies a sudden and significant financial event. The predicted cause is more generic and could encompass a wide range of events, not limited to financial or banking crises. Therefore, it is not an exact match, but it could be considered a partial match if we interpret ""a number of complex and simultaneous events"" to potentially include the sudden bankruptcy of major banks among other things. However, the lack of specificity makes it less directly related.

   **Cause Score**: 0.0 (since it's not directly related and lacks the specificity of the ground truth cause)

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Surge in remote banking services""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the ongoing rise in remote banking services""
   
   Both causes refer to an increase in remote banking services. The terms ""surge"" and ""ongoing rise"" convey a similar meaning of an upward trend. The core concept is the same, and the difference is mainly in the wording. Thus, they are semantically identical.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Decline in physical bank branch numbers""
   - Predicted Effect: ""physical bank branches saw a marked decline""
   
   Both effects talk about a decrease in the number of physical bank branches. The phrase ""Decline in physical bank branch numbers"" and ""physical bank branches saw a marked decline"" convey the same idea. The term ""marked"" adds a nuance indicating the decline was significant, but the core concept of a decline is maintained. Thus, they are also semantically identical.

Given the analysis, both the cause and effect components of the predicted pair match the ground truth pair in terms of semantic meaning.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: Implementation of carbon taxes
   - **Predicted Cause**: implementation of carbon taxes occurred
   
   The predicted cause and the ground truth cause are semantically identical. The phrase ""occurred"" is added in the predicted cause, but it doesn't change the core meaning. Both refer to the implementation of carbon taxes as the cause.

   - **Cause Score**: 1.0 (since they are semantically identical)

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: Increased operational costs for heavy industries
   - **Predicted Effect**: Numerous alternative explanations were proposed
   
   The predicted effect and the ground truth effect are not related. The ground truth effect discusses a specific consequence (increased operational costs) of implementing carbon taxes on heavy industries. In contrast, the predicted effect mentions ""Numerous alternative explanations were proposed,"" which does not directly relate to the implementation of carbon taxes or its expected consequences like increased operational costs.

   - **Effect Score**: 0.0 (since they do not match or are incorrect in the context of the cause)

row17,0.0,0.0,0.0,the technology,increased accuracy in loan approvals,Adoption of AI-driven credit scoring,Increased accuracy in loan approvals,"To evaluate the predicted cause-effect pair against the ground truth pair, let's analyze both the cause and effect components separately.

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of AI-driven credit scoring""
   - Predicted Cause: ""the technology""

The ground truth cause specifically mentions ""Adoption of AI-driven credit scoring,"" which implies the use of a particular technology (AI-driven credit scoring) in the process of credit evaluation. The predicted cause, ""the technology,"" is more generic and does not specify which technology is being referred to. However, in the context of the sentence (considering the effect is related to ""loan approvals"" and ""accuracy""), it can be inferred that ""the technology"" likely refers to something related to improving or affecting loan approval processes, potentially AI-driven credit scoring.

Since ""the technology"" is a broad term and could refer to any technology, not necessarily ""AI-driven credit scoring,"" it is not a precise match. However, it could be considered related if we assume it refers to the same technological advancement implied by the ground truth cause. Thus, it's a partial match because it lacks specificity.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased accuracy in loan approvals""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased"

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Supply chain disruptions due to pandemics""
   - Predicted: ""supply chain disruptions due to pandemics""
   
   The cause in both the ground truth and the predicted pair is identical in terms of wording and meaning. The difference in case (lowercase vs. capitalized first letter) is not significant for the semantic meaning. Therefore, the cause_score should be 1.0.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Inflationary pressures on consumer goods""
   - Predicted: ""inflationary pressures on consumer goods were observed""
   
   The core concept of the effect (""inflationary pressures on consumer goods"") is the same in both pairs. The predicted effect adds the phrase ""were observed,"" which indicates the occurrence or observation of the effect but does not change the core concept or meaning of the effect itself. The addition is more about the context or the way the effect is presented rather than altering the effect's core meaning. Thus, the effect_score should be 1.0 because the core concept is identical, and the additional phrase does not change the semantic meaning of the effect.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Expanded use of blockchain in supply chain finance""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""the use of blockchain""
   
   The predicted cause captures the core concept of using blockchain but lacks specific details about its application in ""supply chain finance"" and the aspect of it being ""expanded."" The core concept of ""using blockchain"" is present, but it's missing important context about where and how it's being used. Thus, it's a partial match because it doesn't fully capture the nuance of the ground truth cause.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Improved transparency in transactions""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""improved transparency in transactions""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect. Both convey the same meaning with the same wording, indicating an exact match.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause: Since the predicted cause lacks important details (application in ""supply chain finance"" and ""expanded use""), it's not an exact match. However, it retains the core concept, so it's a partial match, scoring **0.5**.
- For the effect:"

1. **Cause Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Rise in housing market speculation""
   - Predicted Cause: ""rise in housing market speculation""
   
   The predicted cause is identical to the ground truth cause except for the case difference (""Rise"" vs ""rise""). Since the meaning is the same and case does not alter the semantic meaning, the cause is considered an exact match.

2. **Effect Comparison**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased risk of property price bubbles""
   - Predicted Effect: ""the increased risk of property price bubbles""
   
   The predicted effect includes the definite article ""the"" before ""increased risk of property price bubbles."" The inclusion or exclusion of ""the"" does not change the core meaning of the effect; it is still about the ""increased risk of property price bubbles."" Thus, the effect is considered semantically identical.

Given the comparisons, both the cause and effect are considered to have an exact match or semantically identical meaning.

Therefore, the scoring should reflect this:
- Cause Score: 1.0

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Reduction of foreign direct investment due to economic sanctions""
   - Predicted Cause: ""sanctions""

The predicted cause ""sanctions"" is related to the ground truth cause, which mentions ""economic sanctions."" The core concept of ""sanctions"" is present in both, but the predicted cause lacks the specificity of ""economic"" sanctions and the context of its effect on ""foreign direct investment."" However, ""sanctions"" can be considered a partial match because it is a key component of the ground truth cause. Thus, it captures a crucial part of the cause, albeit not fully detailed.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Slowed economic growth""
   - Predicted Effect: ""the reduction of foreign direct investment""

The predicted effect ""the reduction of foreign direct investment"" is actually the cause mentioned in the ground truth pair, not the effect. The ground truth effect is ""Slowed economic growth,"" which is not mentioned in the predicted pair. Therefore, the predicted effect does not match the ground truth effect.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Strengthened anti-money laundering policies""
   - Predicted Cause: ""these legal adjustments""
   
   The ground truth cause specifically mentions ""anti-money laundering policies,"" indicating a clear and specific type of policy. The predicted cause, ""these legal adjustments,"" is more general and does not directly specify the type of legal adjustments. However, it could be inferred that ""these legal adjustments"" might include or relate to ""strengthened anti-money laundering policies"" if the context implies that the legal adjustments are about anti-money laundering. Despite this potential inference, the predicted cause lacks the specificity of the ground truth cause. Therefore, it is a partial match because it captures the idea of a change in regulations or laws but doesn't specify the area (anti-money laundering).

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased administrative overhead for banks""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased administrative overhead""

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Shift towards digital payment systems""
   - Predicted: ""the shift toward digital payment systems accelerated""

The ground truth cause mentions a ""shift towards digital payment systems,"" indicating a change or movement in the direction of using digital payments more. The predicted cause, ""the shift toward digital payment systems accelerated,"" not only indicates this shift but also adds that it ""accelerated,"" suggesting an increase in the rate of this shift. The core concept of shifting towards digital payment systems is present in both, but the predicted cause adds more detail about the acceleration of this shift. Despite this addition, the fundamental idea is the same.

2. **Effect Component**:
   - Ground Truth: ""Reduced circulation of physical currency""
   - Predicted: ""Physical currency circulation naturally declined""

The ground truth effect is about the ""reduced circulation of physical currency,"" implying a decrease in the amount of physical currency being used or circulated. The predicted effect states that ""Physical currency circulation naturally declined,"" which also implies a decrease in the circulation of physical currency. The term ""naturally declined"" suggests that the decline happened as a normal or expected"

1. **Cause Component**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased frequency of forest fires""
   - Predicted Cause: ""an uptick in recreational land use""

The ground truth cause is about the ""increased frequency of forest fires,"" while the predicted cause is ""an uptick in recreational land use."" Although an increase in recreational land use could potentially lead to an increased frequency of forest fires (for example, through human activity like campfires), the predicted cause does not directly state ""increased frequency of forest fires."" Instead, it proposes a potential reason or contributing factor for the increased frequency of forest fires. Therefore, the predicted cause is not a direct match but is related to the ground truth effect (which becomes a cause in the predicted pair). The core concept is not the same; hence, it is not a direct or semantically identical match.

2. **Effect Component**:

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Expansion of urban areas""
   - Predicted Cause: ""rapid expansion of urban areas""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""expansion of urban areas"" and adds the adjective ""rapid."" The addition of ""rapid"" provides more detail but does not change the fundamental meaning of the cause. Thus, the core concept remains the same, and the addition can be considered as providing additional detail rather than altering the basic meaning. Therefore, the cause can be considered a good match.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Loss of wetlands""
   - Predicted Effect: ""the loss of wetlands was most evident""
   
   The predicted effect contains the phrase ""loss of wetlands,"" which matches the ground truth effect. However, it adds the phrase ""was most evident,"" which changes the nature of the statement from a straightforward effect to a statement about the observability or extent of the effect. Despite this, the core concept of ""loss of wetlands"" is preserved. The addition indicates a consequence or an observation related to the effect rather than changing the effect itself.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of regenerative agriculture practices""
   - Predicted Cause: ""pursuing adoption of regenerative agriculture practices""
   
   The predicted cause includes the phrase ""pursuing adoption,"" which is semantically very close to ""adoption."" The core action or concept of adopting regenerative agriculture practices is present in both. The addition of ""pursuing"" in the predicted cause suggests the process or effort towards adoption, which is a subtle distinction but still closely related to the actual adoption. Thus, the core concept is essentially the same.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased soil carbon sequestration""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased soil carbon sequestration""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect. Both refer to the same outcome of increasing soil carbon sequestration.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Cause**: ""Increased microplastic pollution""
   - **Predicted Cause**: ""elevated currents of increased microplastic pollution""

The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""increased microplastic pollution"" but adds ""elevated currents"" to it. The addition of ""elevated currents"" introduces a new element (the manner or condition under which microplastic pollution is occurring) that is not present in the ground truth cause. However, the core concept of ""increased microplastic pollution"" remains intact. The phrase ""elevated currents of"" could be seen as adding a specific condition or context to the cause, making it more specific but not entirely changing its core meaning regarding microplastic pollution. Thus, it's a partial match because it retains the central idea of increased microplastic pollution but adds an additional detail.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - **Ground Truth Effect**: ""Decline in marine life populations""
   - **Predicted Effect**: ""A decline in marine life populations""

The predicted effect is essentially the same as the ground truth effect, with the only difference being the addition of the indefinite article """

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Implementation of plastic bag bans""
   - Predicted Cause: ""implementation of plastic bag bans""
   
   The predicted cause is identical to the ground truth cause, with the only difference being the case (lowercase vs. uppercase). This is considered an exact match because the meaning is the same.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduction in plastic waste""
   - Predicted Effect: ""reduction in plastic waste in areas""
   
   The core concept of both effects is the ""reduction in plastic waste."" The predicted effect adds the phrase ""in areas,"" which provides additional detail but does not change the core concept. The addition of ""in areas"" could be seen as a minor deviation or specification rather than a significant alteration of the effect. Thus, the core concept remains similar.

Given these observations:

- For the cause, since it's an exact match, the score should be 1.0.
- For the effect, the core concept is similar, but there's an additional detail (""in areas""). This could be considered a partial match because the essential idea of ""re"

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Adoption of electric vehicles""
   - Predicted Cause: ""large‑scale adoption of electric vehicles""
   
   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""adoption of electric vehicles"" but adds the detail ""large‑scale."" While the addition of ""large‑scale"" provides more specificity, it doesn't change the fundamental cause. The core concept remains the same. Therefore, the predicted cause is considered a partial match because it includes an additional detail that wasn't present in the ground truth.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Reduction in urban air pollution""
   - Predicted Effect: ""a reduction in urban air pollution on transit corridors""
   
   The predicted effect contains the core concept of ""reduction in urban air pollution,"" which matches the ground truth effect. However, it adds the specificity ""on transit corridors."" This addition narrows down the scope of where the reduction in urban air pollution occurs. Like the cause, the effect is a partial match because it includes an additional detail not present in the ground truth.

   The predicted cause includes the core concept of ""expansion of offshore wind farms"" but adds an additional detail ""reached commissioning milestones."" The core concept is the same, but the predicted cause provides more specific information about the stage or status of the expansion. The essential idea of expanding offshore wind farms is preserved.

2. **Effect Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Increased renewable energy production""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased renewable energy production""
   
   The predicted effect is identical to the ground truth effect in terms of meaning and wording, just differing in case.

**Scoring**:
- For the cause, since the core concept is the same but the predicted cause includes additional details, it can be considered a partial match. Thus, the cause score should be 0.5.

1. **Cause Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Increased urban heat islands due to construction""
   - Predicted Cause: ""construction""
   
   The ground truth cause mentions ""Increased urban heat islands due to construction,"" indicating that the cause is specifically about the effect of construction on urban heat islands. The predicted cause is ""construction,"" which is a part of the ground truth cause but doesn't directly state the relationship between construction and urban heat islands. However, it captures the core concept that construction is involved. Thus, it's a partial match because it lacks the detail about how construction affects urban heat islands.

2. **Effect Evaluation**:
   - Ground Truth Effect: ""Elevated energy consumption for cooling""
   - Predicted Effect: ""increased urban heat islands""
   
   The ground truth effect is about the consequence of increased urban heat islands (elevated energy consumption for cooling), while the predicted effect is ""increased urban heat islands,"" which is actually the cause in the ground truth. This means the predicted effect doesn't match the ground truth effect; it's actually capturing the cause. Thus, it's not a match.

1. **Cause Analysis**:
   - Ground Truth Cause: ""Severe soil erosion due to intensive agriculture""
   - Predicted Cause: ""intensive agriculture""
   
   The ground truth cause mentions ""Severe soil erosion due to intensive agriculture,"" indicating that intensive agriculture is the cause of severe soil erosion. The predicted cause directly states ""intensive agriculture,"" which is a part of the ground truth cause but does not directly state the cause as ""severe soil erosion."" Instead, it identifies the root cause (intensive agriculture) mentioned in the ground truth. Thus, the predicted cause captures the root cause mentioned in the ground truth but does not directly match the stated cause (""Severe soil erosion""). However, it is semantically related because intensive agriculture is the reason for severe soil erosion in the ground truth. Therefore, the predicted cause is related to the ground truth cause but is more about the root cause rather than the direct cause mentioned. Score: 0.5 (Partial match, as it captures the root cause).
