The predicted cause is more specific by adding a qualifier (\"rapid\") about the speed of the expansion. If \"expansion\" (regardless of speed) is the cause, and \"rapid expansion\" is predicted, they don't mean exactly the same thing. \"Rapid expansion\" is a subset of \"expansion\". Therefore, they are not semantically identical.\n\n    This means the score cannot be 1.0.\n\n3.  **No Match or Incorrect?** No, the core concept \"expansion of urban areas\" is clearly present and correctly identified in the prediction. So, the score is not 0.0.\n\n4.  **Partial Match (0.5)?**\n    The rule states: \"Partial match (core concept is similar but missing important details)\".\n    *   **Core concept is similar:** Yes, \"expansion of urban areas\" is the core concept, and it's present in the prediction.\n    *   **Missing important details:** The prediction is not *missing* details from the ground truth. Instead, it *adds* a detail (\"rapid\").\n    However, given that it's not a 1.0 (not semantically identical) and not a 0.0 (it's a strong match of the core concept), 0.5 is the most appropriate score. The phrases are different due to the detail \"rapid\". The \"missing important details\" clause for 0.5 might be interpreted as the prediction deviating in detail from the ground truth, making it a partial, not full, semantic match. The prediction partially matches because, while the core is there, the added specificity makes it not *identical* to the ground truth's meaning.\n\n    Therefore, `cause_score` is 0.5.\n\n---\n\n**Evaluating the Effect:**\n\n*   **Ground Truth Effect:** \"Loss of wetlands\"\n*   **Predicted Effect:** \"the loss of wetlands was most evident\"\n\n1.  **Exact Match?** No, the predicted effect includes \"the\" and the clause \"was most evident\".\n2.  **Semantically Identical Meaning?**\n    \"Loss of wetlands\" refers to the disappearance or reduction of wetlands.\n    \"The loss of wetlands was most evident\" refers to the same loss but adds information about its perceptibility or prominence.\n    These are not semantically identical. The predicted effect describes not just the loss itself but an observation about that loss. The addition of \"was most evident\" changes the overall meaning beyond just the core effect.\n\n    This means the score cannot be 1.0.\n\n3.  **No Match or Incorrect?** No, the core concept \"loss of wetlands\" (or \"the loss of wetlands\") is clearly present and correctly identified. So, the score is not 0.0.\n\n4.  **Partial Match (0.5)?**\n    *   **Core concept is similar:** Yes, \"loss of wetlands\" is the core concept, and it's present.\n    *   **Missing important details:** Similar to the cause, the prediction is not *missing* details from the ground truth effect; it *adds* contextual information (\"was most evident\").\n    Again, since it's not 1.0 and not 0.0, 0.5 is the most suitable score. The core effect is captured, but the additional clause makes the predicted phrase not semantically identical to the ground truth.\n\n    Therefore, `effect_score` is 0.5.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision Rationale:**\nThe key is the strict interpretation of \"semantically identical meaning.\" Adding qualifiers like \"rapid\" or descriptive clauses like \"was most evident\" changes the precise meaning of the phrase, even if the core concept is preserved. Since they are not semantically identical, a score of 1.0 is not appropriate. As the core concepts are clearly present, a score of 0.0 is also inappropriate. This leaves 0.5 as the best fit, indicating a partial match where the core idea is present but the full phrasing (and thus precise semantics) differs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cause_score\": 0.5,\n  \"effect_score\": 0.5\n}\n```"}

The core concept here is \"Severe soil erosion\". The phrase \"due to intensive agriculture\" provides the cause *of* this soil erosion.\n*   PC is \"intensive agriculture\".\n*   Is PC (\"intensive agriculture\") an exact match or semantically identical to GTC (\"Severe soil erosion due to intensive agriculture\")? No.\n*   Is PC (\"intensive agriculture\") a partial match to GTC? For a partial match, the core concept should be similar. The core concept of GTC is \"Severe soil erosion\". \"Intensive agriculture\" is not \"Severe soil erosion\"; it's stated as its cause. They are distinct concepts in the causal chain. PC is not a version of GTC's core concept with missing details.\n*   Therefore, `cause_score` is 0.0.\n\n**Evaluating Effect Score (PE vs. GTE):**\n*   GTE is \"Reduced land productivity\".\n*   PE is \"severe soil erosion\".\n*   Is PE (\"severe soil erosion\") an exact match or semantically identical to GTE (\"Reduced land productivity\")? No.\n*   Is PE (\"severe soil erosion\") a partial match to GTE? The core concept of GTE is \"Reduced land productivity\". \"Severe soil erosion\" is a different concept. While severe soil erosion can *lead to* reduced land productivity, they are not the same concept, nor is one a less detailed version of the other's core concept. \"Severe soil erosion\" is a cause of \"Reduced land productivity\", not a partial description of it.\n*   Therefore, `effect_score` is 0.0.\n\nThe predicted pair (intensive agriculture -> severe soil erosion) describes the causal step that *leads to* the ground truth cause (\"Severe soil erosion...\").
