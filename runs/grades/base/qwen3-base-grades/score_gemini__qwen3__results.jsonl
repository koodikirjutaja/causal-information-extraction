Evaluate Cause Score (GT_C vs P_C):**\n\n*   GT_C: \"Increased prevalence of invasive species due to global trade\"\n*   P_C: \"global trade\"\n\nThe GT_C describes a phenomenon (\"Increased prevalence of invasive species\") and attributes a cause to it (\"due to global trade\"). The core concept of GT_C, i.e., the actual thing that acts as a cause for GT_E, is \"Increased prevalence of invasive species\". The phrase \"due to global trade\" provides context or the origin of this prevalence.\n\nP_C is \"global trade\".\n*   Is \"global trade\" an exact match or semantically identical to \"Increased prevalence of invasive species due to global trade\"? No.\n*   Is the core concept of \"Increased prevalence of invasive species due to global trade\" (which is \"Increased prevalence of invasive species\") similar to \"global trade\"? No. \"Global trade\" is an economic activity, while \"increased prevalence of invasive species\" is an ecological state/process. \"Global trade\" is stated as the *reason for* the prevalence in GT_C, not the prevalence itself. P_C (\"global trade\") does not capture the core concept of GT_C (\"Increased prevalence of invasive species\").\n\nTherefore, the cause_score is 0.0.\n\n**2. Evaluate Effect Score (GT_E vs P_E):**\n\n*   GT_E: \"Loss of native species\"\n*   P_E: \"increased prevalence of invasive species\"\n\n*   Is \"increased prevalence of invasive species\" an exact match or semantically identical to \"Loss of native species\"? No.\n*   Are the core concepts similar? \"Loss of native species\" refers to the decline or disappearance of native flora/fauna. \"Increased prevalence of invasive species\" refers to the spread and abundance of non-native species. While these two phenomena are often causally linked (invasive species can cause loss of native species), they are distinct concepts. The P_E (\"increased prevalence of invasive species\") is actually the core concept of the GT_C, not the GT_E.\n\nTherefore, the effect_score is 0.0.\n\nThe predicted pair (\"global trade\" -> \"increased prevalence of invasive species\") actually describes the causal mechanism *within* the GT Cause. However, when comparing the predicted cause directly with the ground truth cause, and the predicted effect directly with the ground truth effect, they do not match according to the rules.\n\n```json\n{\"cause_score\": 0.0, \"effect_score\": 0.0}\n```"}
