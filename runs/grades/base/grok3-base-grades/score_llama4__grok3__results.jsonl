The predicted cause talks about the growing demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure, which can be considered a driver or reason for the expansion of data center infrastructure. While they are not exactly the same, they are related in the context that increased demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure often leads to the expansion of data center infrastructure. Thus, they capture related concepts but from slightly different perspectives.
