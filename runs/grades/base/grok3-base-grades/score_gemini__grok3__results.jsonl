Therefore, they are not semantically identical. The PC is more specific than the GTC.\n    So, the score is not 1.0 based on this criterion.\n\n3.  **No Match or Incorrect?** No. The core concept \"expansion of urban areas\" is clearly present and correct in the PC. So, the score is not 0.0.\n\n4.  **Partial Match?** Since it's not 1.0 and not 0.0, it should be 0.5 if it fits the description.\n    The description for 0.5 is \"Partial match (core concept is similar but missing important details)\".\n    *   \"Partial match\": Yes, it's not a full match but not a no match.\n    *   \"core concept is similar\": Yes, the core concept \"expansion of urban areas\" is present in both and is central to both phrases.\n    *   \"but missing important details\": This part of the description is where it gets slightly tricky. The PC (\"rapid expansion of urban areas\") is *not missing* details from the GTC (\"Expansion of urban areas\"). In fact, the PC *adds* a detail (\"rapid\"). The GTC is more general than the PC.\n        However, \"Partial match\" is the main category, and \"core concept is similar\" is met. The phrase \"missing important details\" might be an *example* of what constitutes a partial match, rather than an exhaustive condition. If the match is not perfect (1.0) but the core concept is correct and similar, it falls into 0.5. The deviation here is the addition of specificity (\"rapid\").\n\nGiven the discrete scoring options (0, 0.5, 1.0), and ruling out 1.0 (not semantically identical) and 0.0 (clearly a match of the core concept), 0.5 is the most appropriate score for the cause. The prediction correctly identified the core cause but added a qualifier.\n\n**Cause Score: 0.5**\n\n**Evaluating the Effect:**\nGround Truth Effect (GTE): \"Loss of wetlands\"\nPredicted Effect (PE): \"loss of wetlands\"\n\n1.  **Exact Match?** Yes. \"Loss of wetlands\" and \"loss of wetlands\" are identical strings (ignoring potential case sensitivity, but here even the case matches if we consider \"Loss\" vs \"loss\" as a minor casing difference often ignored, or if the comparison is case-insensitive. The problem doesn't specify case sensitivity, but typical evaluations treat minor case differences as matches if the wording is identical. Here, the provided predicted effect \"loss of wetlands\" is lowercase and matches the typical representation of the ground truth if we ignore initial capitalization for GT). Let's assume standard string comparison where \"Loss\" vs \"loss\" is a minor difference typically allowed for \"exact match\" or at least \"semantically identical\". More precisely, if we treat \"Loss\" and \"loss\" as the same word, it's an exact match.\n\n    If we are extremely strict about capitalization, \"Loss\" is not \"loss\". However, \"semantically identical meaning\" would still apply. \"Loss of wetlands\" and \"loss of wetlands\" have an identical semantic meaning.\n\n    Given \"loss of wetlands\" in the predicted pair is all lowercase, it's an exact match to \"Loss of wetlands\" if we normalize case, or it's semantically identical. The rules provide \"Exact match or semantically identical meaning\" for 1.0. This condition is clearly met.\n\n**Effect Score: 1.0**\n\nFinal JSON structure:\n{\"cause_score\": 0.5, \"effect_score\": 1.0}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cause_score\": 0.5,\n  \"effect_score\": 1.0\n}\n```"}

If encryption standards are enhanced, it is likely that devices will adopt these stronger methods.\n\n4.  **Score:** PE and GTE are not semantically identical (1.0). The core concept of PE (adoption of methods) is different from the core concept of GTE (state of protection). PE describes an action, while GTE describes an outcome of such actions.

The predicted effect is an intermediate step between the ground truth cause and the ground truth effect (and is very similar to the ground truth cause). Neither the predicted cause matches the ground truth cause, nor the predicted effect matches the ground truth effect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cause_score\": 0.0,\n  \"effect_score\": 0.0\n}\n```"}
